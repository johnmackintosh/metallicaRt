## What?

On a whim, this is a collection of colour palettes based on Metallica
album covers.

## Why?

Because I saw [this
post](%22https://github.com/annahensch/R-tutorials/blob/master/ggplot-on-fire.md%22)
on Twitter

## But still, …why?

Because I’d already created a bunch of palettes manually for [this post
on my
blog](%22https://johnmackintosh.net/blog/2018-01-29-hardwired-for-tidy-text/%22)

## I need this in my life

Of course you do

``` r
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("johnmackintosh/metallicaRt")
```

    ## Skipping install of 'metallicaRt' from a github remote, the SHA1 (2cd1ecef) has not changed since last install.
    ##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
