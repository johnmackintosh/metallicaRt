## What?

On a whim, this is a collection of colour palettes based on Metallica album covers.

## Why?

Because I saw [this post]("https://github.com/annahensch/R-tutorials/blob/master/ggplot-on-fire.md") on Twitter


## But still, ...why?

Because I'd already created a bunch of palettes manually for [this post on my blog]("https://johnmackintosh.net/blog/2018-01-29-hardwired-for-tidy-text/")


## I need this in my life

Of course you do

```{r}
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("johnmackintosh/metallicaRt")
```
